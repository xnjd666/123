# Assignment 2 Template

The basic template provided does not need to be used in part or in full in your final submission - you may remove this and replace it with your own code if you would prefer to.

I have provided 4 valid mazes in testdata/mazes/good which your program should accept as valid. I have included some invalid mazes in testdata/mazes/bad which your program should reject as invalid. Note that your final submission will be tested on different mazes which follow the same specifications, and a wider range of invalid mazes.

## To compile

```bash
make
```
This will compile all .c files into an executable named 'maze' as per the spec.

You can remove this and any .o files using:
```bash
make clean
```

## Useful Extensions:
These are useful extensions which I always use in CodeSpace/VSCode when writing C:
- C/C++ Extension Pack (provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion and autoformatting)
- Doxygen Documentation Generator (generates Doxygen comment tags for you (type /** and hit return above a function to generate))


I recommend using autoformat (in Windows - alt+shift+f) to keep your code style consistent.
